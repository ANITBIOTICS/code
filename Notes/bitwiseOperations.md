Bitwise Operations:

bitwise operations operate on bit strings, bit arrays, or bit numerals. 

- are a series of 0s and 1s, working like binary numbers
    ex: 1 1 1 is equal to 7
        1 0 0 is equal to 4

Example:
7 [operator] 4 can be writen as
    


set means 1
unset means 0

There are 6 bitwise Operations:

AND (&) 
- similar to the && operator in booleans

The integer in the same position will only be 1 if the corresponding bits are both set (1). If either of the corresponding bits are unset, then the resulting integer will also be unset.
